        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Project Brief:</h4>
          <p>
            Weigh In: Mobile fitness app concept idea that helps struggling
            gym goers find programs and exercises and tracks internally.

          <h4>The Problem:</h4>
          <p>
            Primary: Many of the users' pain points come from tracking their
            workouts. A main issue is the difficulty of tracking accurately
            when changing weights in-between sets. <br />
            <br />
            Secondary: Often times when users get home from a day's work, they
            do not always want to have to think about what or how they should
            work out. They just want to follow something and that is it.

          <h4>User Interviews:</h4>
          <p>
            Objective: To understand the pain points when trying to find a
            workout routine and tracking their workouts. <br />
            <br />
            I started off the interview by providing the interviewees with a
            brief overview so they have a bit more context to what the
            interview was going to be about. I then moved on to framing
            questions as a way to get them to open up about their past
            experiences with their workout routine and tracking their
            progress. Afterwards, I utilized my general questions in order to
            touch on any specific points I thought could round out the rest of
            their interview with.

            map.

            takeaways from the user interview and later develop a persona that
            best fit the target user. Meet, Marty.

With such a busy lifestyle, he struggles to find and maintain workout programs that fit his schedule. Even when he does, it is even harder for him to keep track of everything.

            just a list of points I want to prioritize. From there, I can pick
            and choose which aspects of the design that I like and can build
            off of. Ultimately, this allows me to be more efficient and focus
            the majority of my time on the later steps.

          After designing the initial prototype, I conducted rounds of usability testing in order to best guide later
          iteration changes.

          <h4>Usability Testing:</h4>
          <p>
            I created a couple tasks for the users to complete in order to gauge their perception of the design.

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Users were confused by the initial filter menu button.</li>
            <li>Users did not know if their actions were performed after clicking some menu buttons.</li>
            <li>Users were confused if they reached their last workout.</li>
          </ol>

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Iteration:</h4>
          <p>Taking the information gathered from the usability testing, I iterated on my design choices to make the
            user experience more intuitive.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Changed to the appropriate filter icon.</li>
            <li>Pop up messages were added.</li>
            <li>Title of the screen was changed and pop up messages were added.</li>

          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of this project has to be the usability testing. At first, I found it difficult to
            get the testers to speak more openly. After doing a couple more tests, I was able to get a better grasp on
            what and how to orient my questions in order for the testers to open up about their experience testing the
            app.

          <h4>Next Steps:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Develop a more appealing notification system.</li>
            <li>Create a better information architecture to make it easier for users to search for workout programs.
            </li>
            <li>Create a full iOS, WatchOS, and MacOS app suite.</li>
