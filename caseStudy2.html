          <h4>Project Brief:</h4>
          <p>
            Xbox App Redesign: Design a new feature(s) for the existing brand that meets the business goals.
          </p>

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>The Problem:</h4>
          <p>
            Primary: Many users spend countless hours to get better at a game. After practicing and earning different
            statuses, titles, and or achievements, they still do not have a good way of displaying their hard work to
            their friends and community. <br />
            <br />
            Secondary: Users that do not have friends to play games with online still want a way to engage with the
            community and see what other players are up to.

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>The Goal:</h4>
          <p>
            Objective was to identify a potential feature to implement that would solve a user pain point while
            maintaining the look and feel of the original brand.

          <h4>The App Itself:</h4>
          <p>
            To start us off, our team simply downloaded the app from the AppStore and went through the process of
            signing up for an account. This allowed us to each have access to, as well as get crucial exposure to what
            the app already has to offer. We then would be able to start thinking about what features were lacking and
            how to design them to have the same look and feel of the existing user experience.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Functionality:</h4>
          <p>
            After going through and using the Xbox App, our team noticed that the Achievements and Social sections of
            the app were very limited in their functionality. We brainstormed collectively to come up with suitable
            survey and interview questions that would allow us to gain the most insight to how users utilize the Xbox
            app currently and what kind of difficulties they face. This allowed us to determine what kind of feature to
            implement in order to help the overall user experience.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>User Surveys:</h4>
          <p>
            Our team sent out user surveys hoping to get an idea of what user tendencies are when it comes to a
            companion gaming app, as well as who is enough of a "gamer" to interview.

          <h4>User Interviews:</h4>
          <p>
            Objective: To discover user habits around game achievements and how users engage with their online gaming
            community. This allowed us to determine pain points they might have while trying to share their achievements
            and with the app itself.

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Research Synthesis:</h4>
          <p>
            With so much data gathered during the user interviews, my team organized everything in an affinity map to
            sort everything and make it easier to find trends. After analyzing the data, we created a persona that
            represented the target user. Meet, Caleb.

          <p>
            Our team did some features comparisons between some direct and indirect competitors to determine how the
            Xbox App stacked up against them. From the results, the app performed just as well if not better in most
            categories, with just a few falling short.

              <ul>
                <li>Keeping in mind that Xbox is still a business, having actual gameplay videos of each game would be
                  beneficial.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Unlike its competitors, the Xbox app does have game clips management

          <h4>Brain Dump:</h4>

            As we started getting a better understanding of what our user needs were as well as what the competitive
            landscape was offering, our team quickly began throwing ideas out on how we should go about tackling this
            redesign. With so many different ideas, it was difficult to decide where and how to focus our attention at
            first, but we reviewed the information we collected earlier in the week and decided on 2 key focuses.

          <p>The user flow was an extremely iterative process since the feature had to fit seamlessly into the

            flow for viewing and sharing achievement clips and highlights.</p>

        <p class="text-center subtext">
          After we finished iterating the prototype our team conducted usability and A/B testing to determine any other
          changes we should make before creating the high-fidelity prototype and mockups.
        </p>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Usability Testing:</h4>
          <p>
            In order to conduct an effective usability testing scenario, Priscilla and I came up with 3 tasks and
            metrics that correspond with our main user flow.
          </p>
          <p>Task 1: Find your most recent achievements and watch the 30 second clip of when you achieved it.
            <br>
            Task 2: Make one of your achievements public to viewers.
            <br>
            Task 3: Locate your friend's achievements and watch the most recent clip.
          </p>
          <p>Metric 1: First task should be done within 2 minutes with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 2: Second task should be done in less than 1 minute with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 3: Third task should be doe within 3 minutes with no more than 1 mistake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
          <p>Task 1: All 3 users had no problems with locating and watching the video clip of their achievement videos
            and finished within allotted time. <br>
            <br>
            Task 2: All users found it was easy to navigate and find the public view toggle. However, 2/3 of the users
            felt the description for the toggle button was a bit vague and would prefer a simple "Public" and "Private"
            description. <br>
            <br>
            Task 3: All 3 users struggled to navigate to find their friends' accomplishments due to misunderstood
            wording for titles or because they saw their friends' achievements in the achievements page.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Iteration:</h4>
          <p>With the usability test data in mind, our team quickly realized the flaws in our designs and understood
            where and how to go about making the necessary changes. Afterwards, we brought the design to a full mockup!

          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <p>
            The most challenging part of redesigning the Xbox App definitely had to be when we lost our team member.
            Even though we only worked together for a short amount of time, bonds and friendships were made. Luckily,
            our team was ahead of schedule and we were able to adapt and split up the remaining work amongst everyone
            else. In the end, I am very happy with my team's work and know that we will be looking to work together
            again in the future!

          <ol>
            <li>Further testing and iteration to the designs.</li>
            <li>Implement more intuitive UX writing and messages.
