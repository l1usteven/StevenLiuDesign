          Cardii.io is a gamified health and fitness platform that promotes
          increased physical activity by creating a community for running and
          tracking progress through captured "turf." By incorporating a playful
          and competitive element to exercising, Cardii.io keeps players engaged
          and motivated on their fitness journey.

          My task was to create a profile screen featuring users' past routes,
          player statistics, earned awards, and the main public feed. I worked
          on this project on and off for five months, but unfortunately, the
          design team had to be dismissed due to financial constraints.

        To understand the method in which players will access their statistics

        <h1>Iterative Prototyping</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        With a general understanding of what players needed in the profile and
        statistics screen, I experimented with several designs before finalizing
        one that incorporated all necessary requirements while maintaining ease
        of use.

    <section id="sect_prototype_sub" class="container flex col">
      <div class="sect_title fade">
        <h1>V1</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        The initial design placed too much emphasis on statistical data, making
        it similar to other run tracking apps. This was revealed in A/B testing,
        where players did not perceive the app as a gamified version of a
        traditional running app.
      </p>
      <div id="img_prototype" class="img fade">
        <img
          class="card hover cardio_shadow"
          src="image/cardio-v1.png"

    <section id="sect_prototype_sub" class="container flex col">
      <div class="sect_title fade">
        <h1>V2</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        The second design introduced consistency throughout the app by
        incorporating a player HUD that would be visible on multiple screens.
        Additionally, the UX copy was adjusted to include more game-like
        elements, and a history log of past routes was added.
      </p>
      <div id="img_prototype" class="img fade">
        <img
          class="card hover cardio_shadow"

      <div class="sect_title fade">
        <h1>V3</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        The final version of this feature separated "History" and "Statistics"
        to give players access to their previous routes and a more in-depth view
        of their statistics. It also introduced "Teams" which allowed players to
        compete on a larger scale while feeling part of a community of
        individuals with a common goal of staying fit.

        As a former track athlete for 7 years, this project held a lot of

        During my time at Cardii.io, I encountered a common challenge faced by
        startup companies - the lack of funding. As a result, I was unable to
        continue with the team. However, the founders were determined and
        eventually achieved a successful launch. Despite my departure, I am
        proud to have been a part of their success and glad that I was able to
        contribute to it.
