          <h4>The Problem:</h4>
          <p>
            Primary: There are many different dashboards and success management systems that are geared towards students to help them do better in school. All of these provide different resources and trackers that aid in this. However, which of these systems help those who help the students? Aside from the students, school counselors, parent coordinators, and student success staff also need a way to share, track, manage and monitor resources shared with students and guardians. Many families are too busy and are overlooking time-sensitive information because they are distributed to parents in a timely manner and in a communication method of the parents' choice.

          <h4>The Web App Itself:</h4>
          <p>
            Being a preexisting product, our team was provided with a developer model of the web app. I was able to take a look at what was already developed along with the style guide that was already in place. So far, there was going to be 3 main login portals; administrator, parent, and student. The student portal was yet to be developed and our scope only encompassed the parent portal, so I started off by diving into the administrator portal to get a better idea of how the application worked. I quickly noticed that the developers simply ported everything from the administrator side over to the student side, so there was a significant amount of unapplicable buttons and information. I simply took note of the features and created a pros and cons list of different elements I noticed throughout.

          After we finished iterating the prototype our team conducted usability and A/B testing to determine any other
          changes we should make before creating the high-fidelity prototype and mockups.

          <h4>Usability Testing:</h4>
          <p>
            In order to conduct an effective usability testing scenario, Priscilla and I came up with 3 tasks and
            metrics that correspond with our main user flow.
          </p>
          <p>Task 1: Find your most recent achievements and watch the 30 second clip of when you achieved it.
            <br>
            Task 2: Make one of your achievements public to viewers.
            <br>
            Task 3: Locate your friend's achievements and watch the most recent clip.
          </p>
          <p>Metric 1: First task should be done within 2 minutes with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 2: Second task should be done in less than 1 minute with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 3: Third task should be doe within 3 minutes with no more than 1 mistake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
          <p>Task 1: All 3 users had no problems with locating and watching the video clip of their achievement videos
            and finished within allotted time. <br>
            <br>
            Task 2: All users found it was easy to navigate and find the public view toggle. However, 2/3 of the users
            felt the description for the toggle button was a bit vague and would prefer a simple "Public" and "Private"
            description. <br>
            <br>
            Task 3: All 3 users struggled to navigate to find their friends' accomplishments due to misunderstood
            wording for titles or because they saw their friends' achievements in the achievements page.

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Iteration:</h4>
          <p>With the usability test data in mind, our team quickly realized the flaws in our designs and understood
            where and how to go about making the necessary changes. Afterwards, we brought the design to a full mockup!

          <p>
            The most challenging part of redesigning the Xbox App definitely had to be when we lost our team member.
            Even though we only worked together for a short amount of time, bonds and friendships were made. Luckily,
            our team was ahead of schedule and we were able to adapt and split up the remaining work amongst everyone
            else. In the end, I am very happy with my team's work and know that we will be looking to work together
            again in the future!
