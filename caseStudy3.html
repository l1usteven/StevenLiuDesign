          <h4>Project Brief:</h4>
          <p>
            We Intervene: Design and integrate parent portal for student success staff for pre-existing EdTech brand, We Intervene.

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>The Problem:</h4>
          <p>
            Primary: There are many different dashboards and success management systems that are geared towards students to help them do better in school. All of these provide different resources and trackers that aid in this. However, which of these systems help those who help the students? Aside from the students, school counselors, parent coordinators, and student success staff also need a way to share, track, manage and monitor resources shared with students and guardians. Many families are too busy and are overlooking time-sensitive information because they are distributed to parents in a timely manner and in a communication method of the parents' choice.

            Objective was to research and design a parent portal that conveys the feelings of uplifting and trusting. This is to be a web app that follows the same look and feel of the pre-existing application.

          <h4>The Web App Itself:</h4>
          <p>
            Being a pre-existing product, our team was provided with a developer model of the web app. I was able to take a look at what was already developed along with the style guide that was already in place. So far, there was going to be 3 main login portals; administrator, parent, and student. The student portal has yet to be developed and our scope only encompassed the parent portal, so I started off by diving into the administrator portal to get a better idea of how the application worked. I quickly noticed that the developers simply ported everything from the administrator side over to the student side, so there was a significant amount of unapplicable buttons and information. I simply took note of the features and created a pros and cons list of different elements I noticed throughout.

          <h4>Competitive and Comparative Analysis:</h4>
          <p>
            Since there was already a working version, our team decided to start off by doing a C&C analysis to determine what sort of features were standard for EdTech software. This would allow us to gauge where We Intervene stacked up against the competition. The features analysis focused mainly on competitors such as; KiNVOLVED, IO Messenger, Pupil Path, Panorama Education (used by NYC School District), Naviance, and ClassDojo. For the comparators, we focused on resource aggregation websites; MyHITE and Aunt Bertha.

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Communication
              <ul>
                <li>KiNVOLVED and IO Messenger both have two-way text messaging compatibilities with parents. Pupil Path also has this feature, but parents need to manually find and enable those settings.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Translation
              <ul>
                <li>KiNVOLVED, IO Messenger, and MyHITE all have translation options for users. After a bit more research of the NYC schools websites, it was determined that Google Translate is the industry standard translation tool in the district.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Saved Resources
              <ul>
                <li>Through our comparators, MyHITE and Aunt Bertha, we found that they both allowed parents to save resources to be reviewed for later. We wanted to make sure that this was possible in our parent portal as well.</li>

          <h4>User Surveys:</h4>
          <p>
            We already knew that We Intervene's target market was New York school high schools, specifically, Brooklyn school districts, with hopes to expand to middle and eventually elementary school. Fortunately for my team and I, during this sprint, We Intervene was actually closing a deal with Frank Sinatra High School in Queens, NY. This meant that we had access to survey and interview parents who's students attended the school. We got a total of 8 survey responses.

          <h4>User Interviews:</h4>
          <p>
            We interviewed a total of 6 parents, 1 sourced from outside the school.<br>
            <br>
            Objective: To discover parents' habits around utilizing educational software to aid their student(s)'s success and how they go about finding resources.

          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Time
              <ul>
                <li>Parents that do end up spending their own time finding resources for their student(s) often times end up spending more time than they would like. This ultimately deters parents from looking since many parents do not have a significant amount of spare time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Information Overload
              <ul>
                <li>When schools do send resources home to parents, whether it is through email or mail, they usually receive too many resources, most of them not applicable to their needs. This causes parents to just trash everything, sometimes even the important resources.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Notification Method
              <ul>
                <li>Parents really want the ability to choose how they receive communications and resources from the school. Some parents are on their phones a significant amount of time throughout the day and do not always check their mail. While others try to avoid their phones after work, and would just like a simple letter about crucial information.</li>

            <li>Access

I wanted to make a note of this to make sure that our sign in process is streamlined and will not deter parents from actually using the application before even being able to log in.</li>

          <h4>Brain Dump:</h4>
          <p>
            After conducting the initial research to gain insight into parents' pain points, I began to understand where to focus the majority of my attention. From here, I wanted to develop an information architecture map in order to show where all the tabs and buttons linked to on each page. This would make it easier to develop a user flow later down the line.

          Using the user flow as a guide, I was able to plan and sketch out how the different screens should look and work together. My team and I started off with removing all of the unnecessary buttons and modules that did not pertain to parents. Then I rearranged what was left of the 'Home' page to meet the needs of parents. After the basic layout was determined, I was able to go back and create a simple user onboarding.

          After we finished iterating the prototype our team conducted usability and A/B testing to determine any other

          <h4>Usability Testing:</h4>
          <p>
            In order to conduct an effective usability testing scenario, Priscilla and I came up with 3 tasks and
            metrics that correspond with our main user flow.
          </p>
          <p>Task 1: Find your most recent achievements and watch the 30 second clip of when you achieved it.
            <br>
            Task 2: Make one of your achievements public to viewers.
            <br>
            Task 3: Locate your friend's achievements and watch the most recent clip.
          </p>
          <p>Metric 1: First task should be done within 2 minutes with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 2: Second task should be done in less than 1 minute with zero mistakes. <br>
            Metric 3: Third task should be doe within 3 minutes with no more than 1 mistake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
          <p>Task 1: All 3 users had no problems with locating and watching the video clip of their achievement videos
            and finished within allotted time. <br>
            <br>
            Task 2: All users found it was easy to navigate and find the public view toggle. However, 2/3 of the users
            felt the description for the toggle button was a bit vague and would prefer a simple "Public" and "Private"
            description. <br>
            <br>
            Task 3: All 3 users struggled to navigate to find their friends' accomplishments due to misunderstood
            wording for titles or because they saw their friends' achievements in the achievements page.

        <div class="case-study-text">
          <h4>Iteration:</h4>
          <p>With the usability test data in mind, our team quickly realized the flaws in our designs and understood
            where and how to go about making the necessary changes. Afterwards, we brought the design to a full mockup!

            The most challenging part of redesigning the Xbox App definitely had to be when we lost our team member.
            Even though we only worked together for a short amount of time, bonds and friendships were made. Luckily,
            our team was ahead of schedule and we were able to adapt and split up the remaining work amongst everyone
            else. In the end, I am very happy with my team's work and know that we will be looking to work together
            again in the future!
